# ScapyScripts

Simply Run the three scripts in seperate terminals:
    UDPClient.py   
    UDPServer.py
    scapy_packet.py
    
Send messages from the UDPClient program, and the UDPServer should reply back. The scapy_packet.py is simply a sniffer
    If malicious strings are written by the client, then the scapy_packet should alert with a message.
